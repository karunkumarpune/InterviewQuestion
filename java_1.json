  "Why cannot you run standard Java bytecode on Android?": [
    {
      "top_name": "Android uses Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) which requires a special bytecode. First of all, we have to convert Java class files into Dalvik Executable files using an Android tool called “dx”. In normal circumstances, developers will not be using this tool directly and build tools will care for the generation of DVM compatible files."

  "What is Java virtual machine (JVM)?": [
    {
      "top_name": "A Java virtual machine (JVM), an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine Specification, interprets compiled Java binary code (called bytecode) for a computer's processor so that it can perform a Java program's instructions. Java was designed to allow application programs to be built that could be run on any platform without having to be rewritten or recompiled by the programmer for each separate platform. A Java virtual machine makes this possible because it is aware of the specific instruction lengths and other particularities of the platform."
