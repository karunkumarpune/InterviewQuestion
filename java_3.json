It inherits the AbstractList class and implements List and Deque interfaces.  The important points about Java LinkedList are:  Java LinkedList class can contain duplicate elements. Java LinkedList class maintains insertion order. Java LinkedList class is non synchronized. In Java LinkedList class, manipulation is fast because no shifting needs to be occurred. Java LinkedList class can be used as list, stack or queue."
